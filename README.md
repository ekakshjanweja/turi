# Turi

A full-stack application with backend and frontend components.

## Project Structure

- `turi_be/` - Backend API (Hono.js with Bun runtime)
- `turi_fe/` - Frontend application (Next.js)

## Getting Started

### Backend (turi_be)

```bash
cd turi_be
bun install
bun run dev
```

### Frontend (turi_fe)

```bash
cd turi_fe
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Development

Both the backend and frontend can be run simultaneously for full-stack development.

The backend runs on port 8000 by default, and the frontend runs on port 3000.
